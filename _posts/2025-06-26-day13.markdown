I filmed my day in the life video yesterday but it was all we could talk about today, approving captions, encouraging Ragan to actually post, and it was the last thing I worked on today (posted to both Insta and LinkedIn) so it is fresh in my mind and gets to be the title for today.

Was actually quite productive in the half hour before dev standup - read danny's PR review, got that merged, downloaded simplecov and ran it on the project, just little things that didn't take to long but sometimes I would think that they need a bigger chunk of time. 75% coverage, pretty good, going to aim for 85-90%, some of the lines are weird and idk how i'd cover them.

 Dev standup and pairing tour with Chris Manning (successfully bough Ren√©e Rapp redrocks tickets in between the two meetings). It was a good pairing tour, we chatted a little to start, Chris asked if there was anything I wanted to look at in my project which kinda surprised me lol I'm used to just getting right into their work. I can tell that Chris is also in this mentor role right now compared to the other devs. I was kind of confused about the high level of what we were actually doing like why we were making changes until about halfway through when I asked, I think we were finishing up the big rebase that Chris was working on for the configurator branch. The configurator branch is so huge and unwieldy, like hundreds of comments and commits and updates on one ticket, and it's a chore keeping it up to date with main. So I didn't know what we were doing at first but it was referencing splitqueryintochunks and the parameter limit, thing sthat I had seen when I paired with Sol, and it turns out we were basically undoing Sol's merge work that he'd done before they decided to go back to the insert delete strategy. Just what happens when you have more than 2 devs on a project, stepping on each other's toes. Got to see CM write some commit messages, using some kind of visual git. At the end it seemed like the rebase was done, he made a draft PR and rebased with main.

 Then we had book club for Blood Test which was so fun! Saw some new people on the call, really good discussion, I contributed some points but frankly had more to say, I could've talked longer than the half hour. I think the book grew on me the more I thought about it. Spent some time editing my video, then had lunch with the interns, where we looked at everyone else's videos, Ragan and Sharon go theirs up, we tried really hard to figure out what song the guy on pearl in my video was singing, and it sounds a lot like Change by Tracy Chapman but that felt like a little bit too serious of a song to be the background for my day in the life video.

 Then we had the intro to BD meeting with Zach. The interns want to start a Matt worship cult / slack channel, we love him he's so joyful and giggly and always nodding along. He knows what's up he has a connection to everything. BD teams goals: financial stability & finding the right project with the right clients. The meeting went over a lot of similar stuff as Andy's meeting, Cindy's intro to contracts, but still very interesting. BD goes after about 1/2 of leads and wins about 1/2 of those. New outbound leads usually take 6 months - 2 years to pay off. Website retainer = a recurring, contractual agreement where a client pays a fixed monthly fee to a web developer or agency for ongoing website support, maintenance, and updates. Budget qualification is most important part of lead qualifying - clients don't know how to self-identify what they need so we need to actually talk to them to figure out pricing. Spec work is when a client asks for work as a part of competitive proposal process for the agency to show off their skills ex build their home page - we don't like that at Viget.

 Then we had our dev intro to Ketchup! Heard a bit about the history, a bit of project scope - weekly toppings as an automated slack bot (which seems quite simple but we'll see how it shakes out), looking at some code. It is an adonisjs web app, full JS framework but it looks and feels similar to Rails apparently. Danny says to add `await` in everywhere and that'll fix most problems. It uses sqlite instead of postgres bc it's simple, there's a sqlite viewer extension for VS code that will help. It sounds exciting and quite doable from the technical side, can't wait to work on a "real" project and get some tickets assigned to me! Ragan is going to do some feature definition then we kickoff on Monday!

 For the rest of the day I ate some apples and peanut butter, set up ketchup locally without too much trouble much to Rhyder's dismay, who had lots of trouble setting it up but I couldn't help much with. Realized it stresses me out to have someone behind me looking over my shoulder which isn't great as a dev but I was like okay you go back to your desk while I relookup my eecs 280 github tutorial to clone this repo then I'll let you know if I get the same error. Then yeah spent a good amount of time editing and finishing up my video, got Ragan's seal of approval on my captions for both insta and linkedin - yep everyone can see my day in the life, Viget can see my instagram, I think that's all fine with me. Didn't get to writing more tests or starting comments today but that's okay, I feel like the ketchup was exciting and took some time. Then I wrote this blog and now it's time to get out of here!
