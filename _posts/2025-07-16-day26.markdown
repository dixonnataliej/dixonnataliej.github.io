Thus concludes my 2nd 12 hour day at the office in a row ! At least today it was fully my choice for an extracurricular activity haha.

God I love it here.

Went to Crossfit before work this morning which was so incredibly hard and also so fun aka I don't know how it was actually fun but the endorphins hit hard so my brain thinks it was fun. ANyways came to the office in desperate need of a shower but first Rhyder had to show me that the button works! IT WORKS! THE SOUND PLAYS! Then I asked wow let's hear it again! And it only plays once lol so that was something to figure out (which he got working later). Took my shower then dev standup. Been slacking on planning(taking two minutes to write bullet points) my YTBs lately so they haven't been super focused.

Databases meeting with Noah! The database guy! IT'S ALL TABLES!! Feel like I finally have a good sense of what an ORM is- I think it's basically like all these different variations on wrapper code so you don't have to write raw SQL, then it'll translate into sql to execute the query. SO in ketchup we're using the lucid ORM and in rails ActiveRecord is the ORM and is how models connect to the DB. Learned you don't actually have to write in all caps. `insert into` is the same as `INSERT INTO`. Some SQL tricks for more complicated commands/queries like `CASE` which is the sql equiv of if-else, a semi join which is more efficient than a join, only adds one basically true false column from the second table (`WHERE EXISTS`). I asked some questions during the presentation to make sure I really understood it, cause queries are kind of my job!

After that I was doing some researching because when I brought up the idea of doing an extension AND a web app this morning Rhyder was pretty anti it and didn't think it was possible and I said uh pretty sure it is Danny and I both think so. He wasn't sure I knew what I was getting into. I watched a video on making a react extension with a rails backend. Chatted with Danny about it. Did some googling, found a few people asking the same question and getting the answer "yeah that's pretty standard" on Stack Overflow. Really seems like the extension the website are just calling to the same server backend. I made a diagram and sent some messages to the Slack.

Ate lunch then had a Ketchup meeting with Brian DiChiara - we chatted about languages and AI in coding. Cool to meet a new person at the company and fulfill Ketchup's intended functionality! Then got to chat with Rhyder about extension and website connection. He determined it was possible (haha what'd I say) and was chatting with CM about it but has concerns related to authentication and storage and hosting/deploying. Rhyder found a way to serve a webpage FROM the extension and use local browser storage which could be good in some way but then the website wouldn't exist on its own and the backend would change (further research from me showed it'd probably have to be full JS, no rails app). We need to talk to Nevin about it and see how we're going to go about hosting and deploying and storing and what Viget will support/pay for.

Office hours with danny - just chatting about the project, we'll see about some S3 buckets, he says we can get around CORS or interact with it properly, not a big issue, we chatted about users- complexity would probably just be authenticating into the extension.

Made myself a hot chocolate with whipped cream :). Pretty soon got into intern project standup which turned out to be really an entire working session haha, determined what core features are and what are add ons, looked through a bunch of stuff sharon has made surrounding features and design and user testing flow, argued about allowed sound lengths and tags, finally did some YTBs, and finished off with NAMES! Sharon had a couple brainstormed and we immediately latches onto Vudos (Viget Kudos) so that's very exciting now we have a name!

Rhyder and I doing some more research and work in the conference room after the meeting, he's pretty much all the way there with the audio of the extension working the way we want it to which is exciting and bodes well. Read thru some stuff for user interview workshop tomorrow. Made some ramen noodles for dinner. Then the Boulder Ruby folks started showing up! Rhyder left and then yeah I was basically the Viget host opening the door welcoming people to my office, "yes I work here but i'm just an intern". There was in fact pizza and beverages! Chatted with Pat a lot at the beginning, met some folks, worked on flipping over the pieces to start the gradient puzzle laura brought in. Showed where the water fountain is, and the knives, and the wifi password. First talk was on serverless architecture - I thought it was okay and did contribute / reinforce my knowledge of AWS a little since I really don't know much about it but to other folks it didn't seem super in depth or valuable. Then they debriefed railsconf and it was cool to hear about this big conference and the logistics and activities and experiences. Ruby might be the next big AI language- lots of well written ruby code out there to train on. RAILS ISNT DEAD! Didn't have much to contribute technically to the meetup and didn't understand everything but it was cool to meet and hear from people and I felt pretty comfortable, nice to be in a space that I know best of everyone. Folks stayed late working on the puzzle (excellent progress) bc of the rain. We're hanging out! Everyone said thank you for hosting haha. Basically my event lol.
