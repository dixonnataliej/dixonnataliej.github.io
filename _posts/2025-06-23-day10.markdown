It's week 3! Thought I'd get in this morning to work on Tommy's MW QA since he wanted it done before EOD and there was a fair amount to do, but alas I was sleepy. So I got here at 9, saw Haroon and Emily and Rhyder on my walk from my car (which I attempted to parallel park but was blocked by some other girl so the world will never know if I would've been capable of it). Checked emails and slack and got my tabs back set up, then dev standup. Then I worked on the QA - Tommy is out sick today so didn't feel as much pressure, just clicking through things making orders requesting quotes making comments when things were weird skipping what didn't work or I didn't know.

Then we had intro to PL/UI with Jeremy which I'd been looking forward to because what is PL/UI?? What is this other secret second dev team? We learned about the history of the team and how it has developed: Front End Developers becoming a thing after originally being a designer job, rise of JS devs which divided the FED team as some JS devs went to Dev team, then FED becoming PL/UI and specializing more between those two sub teams. The UI team builds interfaes for people, using HTML, CSS, some JS (thus React & Vue - for things like nav menus and carousels, not application layer), Tailwind (CSS). They translate dsigns into working pages, extend and flex designs for different screen sizes, and ensure accessibility and productivity standards. I asked about how they decide when to have a UI dev on the project vs the other devs. Other devs can sometimes build off of existing UI work or off the shelf UI systems when there's not much emphasis on design. But if you need *polish*, then you need a UI dev. But as Jeremy says, "the UI team isn't territorial". Then for the Platform Development side- they build and extend sites from off the shelf CMSs, mostly Craft, but some Wordpress, NotifyCMS, etc. Twig is the templating language of Craft. PL also integrates with 3rd party services like Salesforce and extends platform with custom PHP development (which I googled: PHP = Personal Home Page / PHP: Hypertest Preprocessor, scripting language, generates HTML) and works with DevOps to keep platforms up and running and supported. I'm going to try to schedule a 1:1 with Jeremy tomorrow about Platform Dev because I feel like I need to know more about what Craft is to understand what people are talk ing about and what Platform Devs are actually doing. I also feel like it ties into the questions of "there's so many good resources for making a website out there, squarespace etc, why do you need to hire someone to do it?".

Answered the doorbell to a guy from the city asking questions about the property manager which I didn't know anything about lol but I passed his info along.

I had a 1:1 check in with Danny which was good to see him and actually talk, I feel like the just once a week isn't quite enough but hopefully office hours will actually happen this week  so we'll be good. Danny says he can get me onto a client meeting for ACS' Science Olympiad RFP! Then we talked about Git - I should add Danny as a reviewer on my PRs so he gets a notification. Asked about managing different branches and messy commits, kind of got the answer I was looking for, some review of stuff I've been learning like rebase for squashing commits, but good to see it from him, not as much about merge conflicts which still scare me (but foreshadowing I did resolve a merge conflict later today!). Danny says I should SQUASH & MERGE when closing a PR then it will automatically clean up my messy commits I think into just one commit! He also had me start thinking about whether I want to do a blog post for viget.com (FTers get paid for blog posts!). Which leads me to my next point ...

I don't have any super strong ideas about what I'd write a blog post about, though I definitely think I should, but especially like technical stuff who knows. But what I've thought about is writing a post about asking questions, getting out there, outside of comfort zone, making most of internship. And another idea is a blog post about blogging! I've been keeping up this blog for 10 days now, almost perfectly faithfully, doing it in the last 30 min - an hour of the day, and I've written thousands of words already. It's a really good way for me to reflect on and synthesize the day. I take my notes on paper all day long then type them up and add pictures and more info and look up things I starred to do more research on and it's everything I ever wanted to do with my notes at school if I were to be the perfect student. My memory is fallible and this is a way to actually get stuff in there a little better and even if it doesn't stick I can read back my blog posts and it's so organized! I love to journal! I'm like Hamilton, writing writing writing. And here at work in the support of this internship and the time that I have and the quiet office at the end of the day after the full timers leave early, now I can actually use this perfect strategy that I thought about as a student but could never realistically implement. And this blog is a priority to me, maybe I should spend this last hour of the day doing "work", but this feels important to me. It feels good to write the words and save the information.

However it is 5:12 pm so let's stop yapping and finish this post up. For the afternoon I ended up just working more on Pagination - I merged the styling PR after Danny had a look at it, then I brought main & pagination branches up to date - VS code has a handy visual merge conflict resolver tool so that was great and it turned out to only be one line to merge so not scary at all! I styled the page nav bar (aka used the default styling that I pulled in - the grey almost matches what's already there in my styling so I kept it, when I tried to use the exact same grey the two colors looked very different, Chris Jones could probably tell me why they don't appear perceptually uniform(probably HEX's fault)), fixed a lint error (I NEED TO RUN CI CHECKS BEFORE I PUSH TO PR) (I wrote a note for my monitor about it), and then remembered that I should have a test, which I'd already thought about a little, Chat generated it for me easy, I understood it, fixed a very easy problem that it couldn't figure out about what order the articles were in, yay I'm human and have a brain! So yeah messy commits but squash and merge should fix them for me! I did a little bit of research about Devise to finish off the day, found a quickstart tutorial so I should be ready to start tomorrow.

I think I should implement a simple little word count tracker for the blog, trawl it or something. Also I'm going to make a video about being an intern on wednesday for scram points, to go on the linkedin and insta lol.
