The title today is me trying to make what is perhaps a pun on Sharon's EDM dance Labshare (including shuffling) and also the several hours of work I did today on comments for Natalie News. It is 5:43 pm currently so I'm not sure I'm going to actually write this blog post now, maybe just outline and I'll comeback over the weekend or first thing monday.

1:1 with Jeremy about CMSs and platform development - a sneak peek into Viget.com!

FLF! A shoutout from Brian for locking in in my day in the life video.

Comments! Getting the basic stuff together pretty quick, office hours with Danny looking at test coverage and an issue with parameters (requires instead of expect) then I wrote up tests for those which took a while, quite stuck on invalid comment create and I'm still stuck on it, holding me back from perfect 100% coverage, but I got a PR up!
