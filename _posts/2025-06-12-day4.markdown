Much of the day today felt like meetings then little pockets of time in 
between. At Dev Standup I introduced David to the concept/word "popcorn" for 
meetings apparently and there was also an appearance by his bird! 

We had an intro to Lattice meeting, which was interesting to see 
just how important feedback and review and reflection is at Viget. I think 
the weekly updates and 1:1s on Lattice as well as these blog posts will be / 
are good for me because I tend to forget my opinions and the way I felt 
about things pretty quickly (versus like facts and events which stick pretty 
well) so the practice of regular recording is helpful for me. 

After lunch we had Intro to Client Services with Kelly, which we finally 
managed to join after many technical difficulties (I knew from the 
#engineering slack channel that the internet was having a rough time). It 
sounds like very complex work to plan out and manage the projects, and it 
was interesting to hear about pretty much all the projects Viget is working 
on and who's PMing them, as well as to see a contract. I've definitely got a 
list of projects I want to read the Notion project briefs for.

I didn't feel very productive between meetings today - I did some emails and 
slack stuff, a couple Ruby exercises (Exercism is back working again!), 
chose what to order for FLF (FBF for mountain time), chatted with the 
interns, had lunch, got boba. Important 
stuff. Finally got some focus time at 3:30 pm where I did some reading about Ruby on Rails that I'd been wanting to get to and read through the 
hacker news assignment and did some very preliminary set up work. I was 
holding up the office to go to social hour after work because I wanted to 
keep downloading stuff to get the rails app up. I've decided to call it 
Natalie News for the moment. Hope to get at least a bit of good locked in time 
tomorrow bc I'd like to make some tangible progress on hacker news and I 
also have an idea to see if I can get something interactive on the blog. 
Also excited for FLF!

Today I did do some things which are very hard for me which are **reaching 
out**, asking questions, creating/taking advantage of opportunities. I asked Danny 
some questions about meetings, and I asked Kelly if we could meet to learn 
more about time tracking. Kinda simple stuff but for me I get really in my 
head about it. I'd be happy to keep my head down and read things and figure 
stuff out on my own but I know the more I connect with people and the work 
they do the more I will push my self and get the most out of the 
internship!! Planning to slack Maria tomorrow to see if I can learn more 
about the MW project, maybe sit in on the SNAP meetings, learn about product 
management. Everyone's always talking about MW, seems like such a big 
project! I'll definitely also learn some more about it tomorrow on my 
pairing tour with Sol tomorrow and future tours with the other JS devs.
