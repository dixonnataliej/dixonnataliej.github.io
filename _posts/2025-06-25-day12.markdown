It's bike to work day! AKA a  HUGE holiday in Boulder Colorado! First time I've gotten to take advantage of it, I had a lovely ride to work, got two free bagels from Moes(one for me one for Ragan), and a very fancy free breakfast on shrimp and grits, french toast, and an acai bowl from the St Julien right next door! Ate my breakfast at the office while I read a few chapters of Blood Test in preparation for book club tomorrow. And I'm dressed on theme for bike to work day of course.

MW SNAP standup was happening in Run today so I happened to sit in on that, then dev standup. I've been filming videos all day for my scram challenge video, got some good bike to work content, all the devs waving on the screen. Very funny moment in standup today where Chris Jones read the full Boulder Run room name but we pointed out he forgot the comma then he rage quit. Then I puttered a little bit until my pairing tour - checked Slack and emails, made a message inviting folks to salsa dancing, slacked Jeremy about a CMS/Platform dev chat.

My pairing tour with Nick was quite quiet, we got right into a bug ticket, and he narrated everything really well and thoroughly but I didn't have much to contribute or ask about so really just watched and followed along. Maybe didn't make quite as much sense as normal, I think I understood the high level stuff but I was a little tired so it was a teensy bit rough. We were doing a bug where the last win for a quote disappears when you synch. Different branches are on different databases so that migrations don't get mixed up so we spent a couple minutes making sure dbs were up to date so it'd work. I asked what a thunk is: an asynchronous action, might make an api request or dispatch an action, it'll tell you if an action failed or succeeded vs a normal action which will just return. In the partial transform of quote line the synch was currently setting last win to null, so we removed a bunch of set to nulls. That caused some issues with something to do with import / spreadsheets. Found that the normal create extends onto the data shape but import just uses the shape, so we(again, just Nick) made a new function to transform partial quoteline into a state you can store it in as a default. It was a fairly quick fix, only took half an hour, then I go to watch Nick make the PR, he added several lines saying the categories of what actually happened in his commit message, then the PR on github auto had a kind of template to fill out - including like reasoning and some other sections to explain the changes more. (and I can't look up the PR to see bc I don't have MW SNAP repo access sad). We then did a little investigation into another backlog ticket where fixed cost was $0 after synch, what it needs is a validation to see if the value is greater than 0 when it first comes in, but we can't run validation because the issue (which is something like the validation function?) is somewhere else in the file structure so maybe we could bubble it all the way up through all the linked/reference files but that doesn't seem great, Nick took some notes to think about / talk about later. Got a clip for my scram video. I don't want to say that I'm starting to dread the pairing tours, because I do find them super interesting, I think they're great to meet the other devs (a little bit since we don't chat much) and to get exposure to what they're working on so I have much more context for standup, and I am proud of myself for mostly being able to follow along and asking a couple questions here or there, but building on what I was talking about yesterday I'm just not sure if I'm like doing it or presenting myself right. After Rhyder does a pairing tour the dev probably has something to say about it, they don't have anything to say about me after our pairing tours - "oh Natalie was quiet". Like I hope I look engaged and I'm taking notes and I'm nice and personable at least with my hello how's it goings and have a nice rest of your day at the beginning and end but yeah. And as far as I know the pairing tours are not a test of my skills but yeah...

Okey! Then lunch, went to Lolita's with Rhyder and Emily, reviewed the sandwich for scram points. Then I joined the google meet for office hours with Danny (yay! finally!) Didn't really have questions but I just have not shared my screen with Danny yet and I wanted him to see a little bit of me actually working and show him things. Clicked through Natalie News, showed authentication features, my screen might have been a little too small for him to see well (on my big monitor) I should check on that next time. He liked the colors of my git status, I said "lolcat!" but prob didn't explain that as well as I could've. He asked about my VScode and what extension was doing these annoying "Unknown word" messages and I was like idk I just downloaded what Rhyder said to, went through my IDE origin story. When I was clicking through my url bug came up where it is trying to do a git request to non https urls as if they're a part of the app, we worked on that a bit, Danny gave me some things to try that we tested out in the ruby console (`bundle exec rails c`), we found something that kinda worked (I changed it later oop) but yeah really nice to chat with Danny and show him what I'm up to and just such a change from the pairing tours, like Danny still has lots of suggestions(even though he lowkey doesn't know what the project is and has never made a rails app from scratch haha) and tells me things I don't know but I feel some ownership and autonomy.

Said bye and logged off with Danny to lock in on my tests for user authentication so I could get that PR up. Spent at least 5 minutes trying to get a good angle for my phone for a timelapse for the video, then yeah worked on tests and also the link handling. I feel like I'm using chatgpt in a productive way and I figured out the problems (lots of problems with the tests to get them working again after the things I've changed ex all old articles tests needed a user added to the articles and ownership needed to be correct for edit and delete) then just asked chatgpt to solve them for me. Do I still feel self conscious that I can't do anything without it? Yes. Found a very useful shortcut bc I hate commenting out html - Cmd + "/" comments out the highlighted text! Yay!! And yeah that was pretty much the day, got the PR up, wrote a longer commit message with multiple lines, inspired by Nick, and added some screenshots to the PR. Ended the coding work around 4 and was thinking about whether I should start researching for commenting feature but decided to blog in case we left for social hour early, which was a good choice because we have not left for social hour early but I have spent a whole hour typing out this blog post. Yay company time!
