I fear this is going to be another outline - I'm getting behind on the blog ahhhh.

Brought in some new puzzles for the office, dev standup, made a test for the invalid comment to get full coverage. Read the State of Devs 2025 report that was sent in Slack.

Pairing tour with Nevin this was lovely we chatted he helped me shut down my AWS instance I saw some devops work, copy and pasting redirecting urls.

Ketchup kickoff - probably working on that this week, testing next week and deploying. Some confusion over feature definition, Aubrey and Lauren perhaps have different ideas for the project.

1:1 with Danny

Natalie News work bc no Ketchup tickets quite yet. Self referential comments, reset password didn't need anything, in the weeds trying to insert a react component for replies, I will ask Danny about it.

Okay time to social hour! To game!
