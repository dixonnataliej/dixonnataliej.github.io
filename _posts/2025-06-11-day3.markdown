 Today was picture day! After dev standup (and enjoying some scones I made 
 and brought to the office) we stood outside on the balcony 
 and got some beautiful portraits taken by Steven, then we had a lot of fun 
 with group pictures.

Then I settled in to work on learning some Ruby via the Excercism course but 
 soon ran into a problem where the test cases on the online editor were 
 timing out - and I was pretty sure my simple addition lasagna class didn't 
 have any infinite loops. A search of the forums told me that it's a known 
 problem and will hopefully be fixed "very soon". 

Then we had a meeting on Viget Services and Teams with Steven which was 
super interesting to see every single person at the company and what they do.
Learned about the difference between Project vs Product Managers and Product vs 
Visual Design. The User Experience Strategy and PL/UI Development teams were 
two I hadn't really known about at all. In terms of Viget work we talked 
about project-based vs team extensions projects then looked at some really 
cool projects Viget is/was a part of such as the National Parks Foundation 
and Stern Pinball. We also got sandwiches on Viget which was excellent.

Right before lunch I had a stroke of inspiration on my blog styling so 
afterwards I worked on that. I spent a decent hour and a half trying to 
figure out how to work with the jekyll minima template I was already using 
and in order to just add a few custom elements to the base. But it got to be 
quite 
confusing with what files I needed to create and 
write over vs the hidden ones included in the theme and getting the css 
files to work together. So I eventually just 
ended up downloading all the theme files so that I could see them and work 
on them directly instead of overwriting with my own. And thus I was able to 
style my blog post titles on the home page into the Viget dots!

To finish off the day I finished off a first draft of my Viget.com bio, sent 
some emails, and wrote this blog post!
